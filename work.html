            <p>This interactive weather app was created using OpenWeatherMap API giving you real-life data and forecast for any location around the world. Find your city with the search function or simply use your current location with a single click. It will show the current temperature, humidity, wind speed and provide you with a six-day forecast. Change the location to see different comments matching the weather forecast of your inserted city. You can even choose to view the weather temperature in Â°C or Â°F whatever is more suitable for you.

            <p>This interactive weather app was created using React. It is using OpenWeatherMap API giving you real-life data and forecast for any location around the world. It will show you the current temperature, humidity, wind speed and provide you with a five-day forecast. You can even choose to view the weather temperature in Â°C or Â°F whatever is more suitable for you. This weather app is similar to the previous project with the difference that it was created using React instead of Vanilla JS.

            <p>This interactive dictionary app was created using React. It is using two APIs - Dictionary and Pexels. Use the search bar to find the corresponding word definitions, meanings, synonyms, and images. If you are having troubles reading the phonetics there isgi an audio function which can help you with the pronunciation of the results.

            <p>This was my very first coding project I created. The task was to create a simple landing page from scratch about something I am passionate. In my case that is Scuba Diving ðŸ¤¿  
              <br>
              Have fun exploring the page and learning more about the little or big guys you can meet underwater.
